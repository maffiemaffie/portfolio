For the organization I work at, I led an initiative to redesign our brand from the ground up, creating new logos, picking out typography and colors, and designing social media graphics and icons.


## Background
![old outspoken logo](assets/old-logo.png)

OUTspoken is a Student Government organization at RIT that advocates for LGBTQ+ students and provides free resouces, hosts events, and coordinates all LGBTQ+ clubs at RIT.

Not only did OUTspoken's old logo struggle to convey the purpose of the organization, it also lacked versatility.


## A New Logo
The core challenge was how do you create a symbol for the Queer community that **doesn't rely on a rainbow?**

Some of the most commonly used symbols derive from the Venus and Mars symbols (⚢, ⚣, ⚧). But there is no single symbol that unites both sexuality and gender.

Another option was the Greek letter lambda (λ), associated with the Gay Activists Alliance. However, this was a dead-end as the GAA notably downplayed the contribution of transgender activists to Queer liberation.

We settled on a heart, a simple and universal symbol of love and unity. When possible the logo is used alongside rainbow colors; but even in its monochrome form, it still represents OUTspoken's committment to unity.

As for OUTspoken's role in Student Government, we use a megaphone to represent OUTspoken's commitment to amplifying queer voices. The logo doubles as a nod to the "spoken" in the organization's name.

## Colors and Flags

We started with the eight colors of the original pride flag, designed by Gilbert Baker in 1978. We then expanded the colors to allow for a wide range of pride flags to be made using OUTspoken's colors.

## The Finishing Touches
All that was left to do was add some neutral tones for typography and put together the wordmarks, lockups, and social media icons!
