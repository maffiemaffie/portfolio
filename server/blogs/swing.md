Swing is a unique take on the shoot-em-up genre, featuring a peculiar style of movement. Use your mouse to sling and whip around, shooting enemies as they chase you down. Charge up your special attack by tricking enemies into shooting each other and press `[SPACE]` to discharge a huge pulse of energy (plus a little bonus health for you <3)! Just be careful not to get hit too badly.
