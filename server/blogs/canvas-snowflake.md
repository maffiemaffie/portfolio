When I started coding in Scratch, one of my favorite projects I made was a simple program that drew a Koch snowflake fractal. A Koch curve is formed by iteratively placing an equilateral triangle in the center of each edge in the curve. A snowflake is formed by putting three curves together (or by starting from an equilateral triangle).

Using the Canvas API with HTML's `<canvas>` element, I reproduced the project in the browser, this time drawing not just one but a flurry of snowflakes.
