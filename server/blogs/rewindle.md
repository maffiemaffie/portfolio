Inspired by games like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and [Spotle](https://spotle.io/), Rewind.le creates a new game, personalized to *your* music. By accessing your Last.fm data, Rewind.le lets you guess from your top 100 albums, unlocking a clue with each guess.

Play at [rewindle.app](https://rewindle.app)

## Sync your Last.fm data
It all starts with your Last.fm. Let Rewind.le find your account for you and sync your scrobbles!

## Make your first guess
Now you're ready to make your first guess! Rewind.le tells you four pieces of information about the album you just guessed: its **release year**, its **rank** out of your albums, its **artist**, and the **number of tracks** on the album. For each attribute, Rewind.le tells you if the value is the same in the target album, or how far off it was.

## Guess the album!
When you find the correct answer, the attributes will all turn green!
