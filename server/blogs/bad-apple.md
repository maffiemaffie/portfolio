Recreating [this Bad Apple music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8) is a popular meme on the internet. One of my favorite personal projects is my own recreation.

For each frame, I create a mosaic of tiles, except each tile can only be one of the frame from the video. The source code can also be used to recreate any image or video as a mosaic of tiles from a bank of images.
